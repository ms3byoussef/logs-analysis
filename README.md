# SQL Logs Analysis Tool 
An internal reporting tool for a newspaper website that determines: what are the most popular articles, who are the most popular authors, what percentage of requests returned errors and then prints out that information.

Runs in Vagrant's VM. 

Part of Udacity's Introduction to Programming Nanodegree.
### Installation
Requires Udacityâ€™s Linux-based virtual machine and associated news-website database.
Instructions for installing the VM and data follow.
#### Requirements:
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
* [Newsdata](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57b5f748_newsdata/newsdata.zip)

Note: install Vagrant into a different directory from VirtualBox.

#### Set-up the VM:
* Navigate to the Vagrant directory.
* Set up the machine.
* Log in.
```
cd /path/fsnd-virtual-machine/vagrant
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```
* Outside the machine, place unzipped data file into the vagrant directory.
* cd back into the vagrant directory
``` cd /path/fsnd-virtual-machine/vagrant```
* Load the dataset.
```
psql -d news -f newsdata.sql
```

### Run Application
Log in to VM.
```
vagrant ssh
```
cd into shared directory:
```
$ cd /vagrant
```
Commandline should now look like this:
``` vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant$ ```

Run:
```
$ python logs-analysis-rev.py
```
## Note:
The order of the SQL queries contained in the list: *query_list* is crucial; *query_list* or elements thereof are passed into a number of functions which depend on the order of the elements in *query_list*. Specific functions that will need to be adjusted if query_list is modified are:
```
format_authors_articles()
format_errors()
final_solution_layout()
```
